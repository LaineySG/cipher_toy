Cipher tool that encodes and decodes test to various cipher types. Currently allows for caesar, vigenere, atbash, affine, baconian, railfence, and ROT13 cipher types. More to be added in the future.
Also allows for brute forcing with a likelihood analysis tool to try to guess what the correct output is based on how close to english it seems.
